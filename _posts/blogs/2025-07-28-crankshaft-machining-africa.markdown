In the demanding environments of Africa’s power plants, marine fleets, mining sites, and industrial operations, crankshaft failure can lead to serious downtime. **Crankshaft machining** is a critical process used to restore engine performance, correct dimensional faults, and **avoid costly replacement**.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we provide expert **crankshaft machining services across Africa**, ensuring large and small engines continue operating with reliability and efficiency.

### **What Is Crankshaft Machining?**

Crankshaft machining is the precision process of reworking the crankshaft’s:

- **Main journals**  
- **Crankpins (rod journals)**  
- **Flanges, keyways, and counterweights**  
- **Oil holes and thrust faces**

Using advanced tools—either in our workshop or at your site—our technicians restore worn or damaged surfaces, eliminate vibration, and return crankshafts to OEM specifications.

---

### **When Crankshaft Machining Is Required**

- Scored or worn journals from bearing failure  
- Surface cracks or heat damage  
- Journal taper, ovality, or misalignment  
- Deformation or unbalanced crankshaft  
- Crankshaft seizure or oil starvation incidents  

Rather than replace the entire crankshaft, machining allows you to **restore function and extend engine life**.

---

### **Our Crankshaft Machining Capabilities**

- **Onsite machining** of crankpins and main journals (in situ)  
- **Workshop-based machining** for crankshafts of all sizes  
- Undersize grinding to precise tolerances  
- Journal welding and rebuilding (if required)  
- Crack detection (MPI/DPI), hardness testing, and balancing  

We support crankshafts used in:

- Diesel and gas engines  
- Marine propulsion systems  
- Power generators and turbines  
- Mining and construction machinery  
- Oil & gas processing and transport  

---

### **Benefits of Crankshaft Machining**

- **Cost-effective** alternative to crankshaft replacement  
- **Faster turnaround** with in situ machining options  
- **Precision tolerance restoration** to prevent further damage  
- **Improved balance** and engine efficiency  
- **Longer engine life** with properly reconditioned components
