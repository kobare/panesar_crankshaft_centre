Large engines are critical to power generation, marine propulsion, mining operations, and heavy industry throughout Africa. When a crankshaft becomes worn, scored, or misaligned, **in situ crankshaft grinding repair** is the fastest and most economical solution—**restoring performance without removing the crankshaft**.

### **What Is In Situ Crankshaft Grinding?**

In situ crankshaft grinding is the process of regrinding damaged crankshaft journals **while the crankshaft remains installed in the engine block**. Specialized portable grinding equipment is used to restore journal geometry and surface finish—eliminating the need for costly dismantling or overseas repair.

### **Why It Matters in Africa**

Transporting crankshafts for repair can be time-consuming, expensive, and risky—especially for:

- Power stations in remote regions  
- Marine vessels operating at port  
- Refineries and offshore rigs  
- Heavy-duty generators and engines in mining  

With in situ repair, your operation stays on-site, and downtime is minimized.

### **Common Crankshaft Issues Resolved by In Situ Grinding**

- Scored or worn crankpin and main journals  
- Ovality and taper on journal surfaces  
- Surface cracks or fatigue marks  
- Misalignment or vibration-causing damage  
- Bearing seizure and localized heat spots  

### **Industries That Rely on In Situ Crankshaft Grinding**

- **Thermal and hydroelectric power generation**  
- **Oil & gas plants and FPSOs**  
- **Marine and ship engines**  
- **Mining and earthmoving equipment**  
- **Industrial diesel and gas generators**
