A crankshaft is the heart of every diesel engine—and failure can result in catastrophic downtime and repair costs. Across Africa’s marine, power, and industrial sectors, **onsite inspection of crankshafts** is critical for ensuring continued reliability, identifying faults early, and avoiding unplanned breakdowns.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we offer expert **onsite crankshaft inspection services across Africa**, using precision instruments and proven diagnostic techniques.

### **Why Onsite Crankshaft Inspection Matters**

Removing a crankshaft for inspection can be costly, time-consuming, and impractical—especially for large engines in remote or offshore locations. **Onsite inspection** allows trained technicians to assess the crankshaft's condition **without dismantling the engine**, saving time and avoiding unnecessary disruptions.

### **What Does Onsite Crankshaft Inspection Involve?**

Our comprehensive inspection includes:

- **Visual Examination**: Checking for cracks, scoring, or surface defects  
- **Dial Gauge Measurement**: Measuring journal runout and deflection  
- **Hardness Testing**: Verifying material strength and wear resistance  
- **Magnetic Particle or Dye Penetrant Testing (MPI/DPI)**: Detecting surface cracks  
- **Journal Diameter and Ovality Checks**: Confirming tolerances and geometry  
- **Vibration and Alignment Checks** (if engine is operational)  

All results are documented in a detailed report, enabling informed decisions on repair, grinding, or overhaul.

### **Industries That Benefit from Crankshaft Inspection in Africa**

- **Power generation (diesel, HFO, gas)**  
- **Marine and shipping**  
- **Oil & gas operations**  
- **Mining and earthmoving**  
- **Industrial backup generators and process plants**  

Whether it’s a power station in a remote region or a vessel at port, our inspection team can be deployed rapidly.

### **Benefits of Onsite Crankshaft Inspection**

- **Minimize downtime** by identifying issues early  
- **Avoid unnecessary disassembly or shipping**  
- **Plan repairs proactively before failure occurs**  
- **Ensure safe operation of high-value machinery**  
- **Support insurance and warranty claims with certified reports**  

### **What to Expect from Panesar Crankshaft Centre**

- Qualified engineers and experienced inspectors  
- Portable, calibrated tools and NDT equipment  
- Fast mobilization to any location in Africa  
- OEM-aligned procedures and reporting standards  
- Recommendations on regrinding, metal stitching, or overhaul (if needed)  

### **Preventative Maintenance Starts with Inspection**

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we help clients extend crankshaft life, avoid unexpected failures, and maintain operational continuity. Our **onsite crankshaft inspections** provide actionable insights to keep your equipment running smoothly—no matter where it's located.
