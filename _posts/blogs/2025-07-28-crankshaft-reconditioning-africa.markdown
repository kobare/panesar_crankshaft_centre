A worn or damaged crankshaft can bring even the most powerful diesel engine to a standstill. In Africa’s power plants, marine vessels, refineries, and mining operations, **crankshaft reconditioning** is a cost-effective, precise solution that restores engine integrity—**without the expense of full replacement**.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we offer expert **crankshaft reconditioning services across Africa**, ensuring your engines return to peak performance quickly and reliably.

### **What Is Crankshaft Reconditioning?**

Crankshaft reconditioning involves a series of **inspection, machining, grinding, polishing, and alignment processes** that restore the crankshaft’s critical surfaces to manufacturer specifications.

This service can be applied to:

- Crankpins (big end journals)  
- Main journals  
- Keyways and fillets  
- Flange faces and bolt holes  
- Surface cracks and heat spots  

### **When Is Crankshaft Reconditioning Needed?**

- Scoring or wear from bearing failure  
- Journal taper or ovality  
- Misalignment or excessive runout  
- Surface cracks from overload or seizure  
- Heat discoloration or hard spots  

Prompt reconditioning can prevent further damage to bearings, connecting rods, and engine blocks—saving major repair costs down the line.
