MAN engines are trusted worldwide for their performance in marine vessels, power plants, and industrial equipment. But when crankshaft damage occurs, even the most robust engine is at risk of unplanned shutdowns. That’s where **in situ crankshaft grinding** comes in—restoring crankshaft surfaces to full functionality **without engine removal**.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we provide specialized **onsite crankshaft grinding for MAN engines** across Africa, using precision equipment and OEM-guided procedures.

### Why In Situ Grinding for MAN Engines?

Crankshafts can suffer from wear, scoring, heat damage, and journal misalignment due to bearing failure or lubrication issues. Replacing or removing a crankshaft is expensive and time-consuming. With **onsite grinding**, the crankshaft is repaired in place—minimizing cost and downtime.

### Supported MAN Engine Models

Our team is equipped to service a wide range of MAN diesel and dual-fuel engines, including:

- MAN B&W 6L23/30, 8L28/32, 9L48/60  
- MAN 32/40, 48/60CR, and 51/60DF engines  
- MAN L and V series trunk piston engines  
- MAN two-stroke marine engines  
- Stationary MAN engines used in power generation

Whether on a cargo vessel, offshore platform, or inland power station, we deliver precision grinding aligned with MAN’s technical specifications.
