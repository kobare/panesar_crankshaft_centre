A worn or damaged crankshaft can bring vital engines to a halt. In Africa’s demanding power, marine, and industrial environments, **crankshaft grinding** is the go-to solution for restoring performance, extending engine life, and avoiding costly replacements.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we offer precision **crankshaft grinding services across Africa**, supporting industries that depend on reliable rotating machinery.

### **What Is Crankshaft Grinding?**

Crankshaft grinding is a machining process that restores the crankshaft's journal surfaces—**main journals and crankpins**—to exact manufacturer tolerances. It removes wear, deformation, and surface damage caused by:

- Bearing failures  
- Overheating or oil starvation  
- Scoring, taper, or ovality  
- Vibration and imbalance  

The journals are ground to precise undersize dimensions and finished with a polished surface suitable for new bearings.

### **Where Crankshaft Grinding Is Used**

We grind crankshafts for:

- **Diesel and gas engines**  
- **Marine propulsion and auxiliary engines**
