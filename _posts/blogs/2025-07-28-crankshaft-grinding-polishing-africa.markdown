In the engine world, **precision is everything**. A crankshaft’s surface finish plays a vital role in the lubrication and smooth operation of internal combustion engines. Across Africa’s power generation, marine, oil & gas, and industrial sectors, **crankshaft grinding and polishing** is an essential service that restores journal geometry, eliminates damage, and ensures optimal bearing contact.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we offer specialized **crankshaft grinding and polishing services across Africa**, helping clients protect their engines and avoid expensive downtime.

### **Why Grinding and Polishing Go Hand-in-Hand**

- **Grinding** removes material to restore proper roundness, diameter, taper, and journal alignment.  
- **Polishing** follows grinding to achieve a mirror-smooth surface finish that enhances bearing performance and oil retention.

Together, these processes **restore crankshaft journals to OEM standards**, improving efficiency, reliability, and durability.

---

### **Common Issues That Require Grinding and Polishing**

- Journal scoring due to bearing failure  
- Heat spots, hardening, or blueing  
- Ovality or taper from long-term wear  
- Minor surface cracks and pitting  
- Vibration or noise from imbalance  

These issues—if ignored—can result in severe engine failure. Our grinding and polishing services bring the crankshaft back to full working condition.
