Cracked engine blocks can bring operations to a halt—but replacing them is often expensive, time-consuming, and logistically challenging. **Metal stitching**, also known as **cold metal repair**, offers a permanent solution for repairing cast iron or cast aluminum engine blocks **without welding or heat distortion**.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we provide expert **metal stitching of engine blocks across Africa**, restoring structural integrity with precision and reliability.

### **What Is Metal Stitching?**

Metal stitching is a **cold repair technique** that involves inserting a series of specially designed metal locks and stitching pins across a crack to **mechanically restore strength** to damaged castings. It is ideal for materials that are heat-sensitive or prone to further cracking during welding.

This process is used to repair:

- Engine blocks  
- Cylinder heads  
- Crankcases  
- Pump casings  
- Compressor housings  

### **Why Choose Metal Stitching Over Welding?**

- **No heat input**: Avoids thermal stress, distortion, and weakening  
- **Permanent solution**: Restores full mechanical strength to the casting  
- **Precision controlled**: Stitching pattern follows the exact crack path  
- **Suitable for all environments**: Ideal for marine, industrial, and remote settings  

### **Common Engine Block Damage Repaired by Stitching**

- Cracks between cylinders or coolant passages  
- Fractures from freezing or hydraulic lock  
- Stress cracking from operational overloads  
- Casting porosity or structural separation  
- Crankcase cracks and oil leaks  

### **Applications Across African Industry**

Metal stitching is trusted in:

- **Power generation engines**  
- **Marine propulsion systems**  
- **Mining and construction equipment**  
- **Oil & gas compressors and pumps**  
- **Heavy-duty transport and generators**  

We restore engine blocks for clients across Africa’s industrial, marine, and energy sectors—saving time and cost over full replacements.
