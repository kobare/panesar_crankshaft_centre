In high-performance diesel and gas engines, the **crankshaft’s surface finish** is critical for smooth operation, oil film retention, and bearing life. Across Africa’s energy, marine, and industrial sectors, the use of a **crankshaft polishing machine** ensures that journals achieve the mirror-like finish required for optimal engine performance.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we utilize advanced **crankshaft polishing machines**—both in situ and workshop-based—to support precise, efficient crankshaft restoration across Africa.

### **What Is a Crankshaft Polishing Machine?**

A crankshaft polishing machine is a tool designed to **refine the surface finish** of crankpins and main journals after grinding or minor repair. Using specialized abrasive belts or pads, the machine removes micro-scratches, high spots, and minor imperfections—without altering the journal's critical dimensions.

---

### **Why Use a Polishing Machine Instead of Manual Polishing?**

- **Consistent surface finish** across all journals  
- **Controlled pressure and speed** to avoid over-polishing  
- **Faster and more uniform** than hand tools  
- **Compatible with all crankshaft materials and sizes**  
- **Improves bearing life and reduces friction**  

A proper polish can mean the difference between a crankshaft that lasts years and one that fails prematurely.

### **Applications of Crankshaft Polishing Machines**

- Final step after crankshaft grinding  
- Surface correction for journals with light scoring or fretting  
- Onboard engine maintenance in marine and FPSO vessels  
- Diesel generators and stationary engines in power plants  
- Mining and heavy equipment crankshafts  

Whether you’re polishing crankshafts on a vessel in Mombasa, a refinery in Nigeria, or a power station in Ghana, we bring **portable polishing machines** to your engine.
