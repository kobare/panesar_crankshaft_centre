When a crankshaft develops wear, scoring, or journal damage, engine performance begins to suffer—and if left untreated, total failure may follow. Across Africa’s demanding industrial, marine, and power generation sectors, **crankshaft grinding repair** is the fastest and most reliable method to **restore precision and extend engine life**.

At **Panesar Crankshaft Centre**, we specialize in **crankshaft grinding repair services** throughout Africa, delivering high-accuracy results in our workshop or directly at your engine site.

### **What Is Crankshaft Grinding Repair?**

Crankshaft grinding is the process of **reprofiling worn or damaged crankpins and main journals**. Using specially calibrated grinding tools, material is removed in controlled passes until factory tolerances are restored.

The journals are then polished and measured to ensure:

- Correct diameter and roundness  
- Uniform oil clearance  
- Surface finish for bearing compatibility  
- Elimination of taper, ovality, and heat damage  

---

### **Common Issues Repaired by Crankshaft Grinding**

- Bearing seizure or scoring  
- Crankpin blueing due to overheating  
- Tapered or out-of-round journals  
- Journal surface cracks or pitting  
- Vibration and noise due to imbalance  

Instead of replacing the entire crankshaft, grinding can **restore full function quickly and cost-effectively**.
